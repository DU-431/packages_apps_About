Based on Android Open Kang Project (AOKP)

This ROM was originally made out of pure boredom and for personal use. After sharing it with a few people, we decided to take it a step further and turn it into something special while still having fun. Since then we've decided to share this ROM with the community and have ported it over to several devices to include the GNEX, Nexus 4, HTC One, Note 2, EVO 3D and many more devices!
