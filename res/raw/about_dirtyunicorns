Based on Android Open Kang Project (AOKP)

The idea to start a ROM based off AOKP with added features for us was started out of curiosity and boredom. We started compiling ROMs for personal use and later started sharing them. After sharing it with a few people, we decided to take it a step further and fine tune the way we do things. Since then, is been nothing but fun and a true learning experience for all of us involved. We've received high praise from not only users but fellow developers of other ROMs that enjoy seeing things done the right way.
